I need to add a new page/feature to my existing project. Please follow the comprehensive guide at docs/NEW_FEATURE_GUIDE.md and implement the complete solution.

## üìù Feature Details:

**Feature Name**: [REPLACE_WITH_FEATURE_NAME]
**Page URL/Route**: [REPLACE_WITH_URL]
**Authentication Required**: [YES/NO]
**User Permissions**: [REPLACE_WITH_PERMISSION_REQUIREMENTS]
**Main Functionality**: [REPLACE_WITH_DESCRIPTION]
**API Endpoints**: [REPLACE_WITH_ENDPOINTS_OR_N/A]

## üéØ Requirements:

Please implement the following following the manual approach from the guide:

1. **Create Page Object Class** (`src/pages/[feature-name].page.ts`)
   - Extend BasePage
   - Use data-testid locators primarily
   - Include all necessary methods for the functionality
   - Follow existing naming conventions

2. **Update Index File** (`src/pages/index.ts`)
   - Export the new page object

3. **Update Test Fixtures** (`src/fixtures/test.fixtures.ts`)
   - Add the page object to PageObjects type
   - Add fixture for both regular and authenticated tests
   - Follow existing patterns

4. **Create E2E Tests** (`tests/e2e/[feature-name].spec.ts`)
   - Include smoke tests (@smoke tag)
   - Include regression tests (@regression tag)
   - Test both happy path and edge cases
   - Use the custom fixtures
   - Include proper test organization with describe blocks

5. **Create Visual Tests** (`tests/visual/[feature-name].visual.spec.ts`)
   - Screenshot tests for different states
   - Mobile and desktop views
   - Include animation disabling

6. **Create API Tests** (`tests/api/[feature-name].api.spec.ts`) - if applicable
   - Test CRUD operations
   - Use APIHelpers utility
   - Include proper status code assertions

7. **Create Permission Tests** (`tests/e2e/[feature-name]-permissions.spec.ts`) - if applicable
   - Test different user role behaviors (admin vs normal user)
   - Verify UI elements shown/hidden based on permissions
   - Test unauthorized access attempts
   - Include API permission testing

8. **Skip Accessibility Tests** for now (as noted in the guide)

## üîß Technical Requirements:

- Follow the project's import path conventions (`@fixtures`, `@pages`, `@utils`)
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Include proper error handling
- Use existing utilities (DataGenerator, TestHelpers)
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Include comprehensive test coverage

## üìä Expected Deliverables:

- Complete page object class with all locators and methods
- Updated fixtures file
- Updated index file  
- Comprehensive test suite (E2E, Visual, API)
- All tests should be runnable with existing npm scripts
- Code should pass TypeScript compilation and linting

Please implement this step by step, ensuring each file integrates properly with the existing template structure.
